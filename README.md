## Overview
This is a building temperature control system where users can manage the temperature of various rooms in a building. 
The system allows the user to set the desired building temperature and add rooms dynamically (both apartments and common rooms). The system adjusts the temperature of the rooms accordingly.

## Assumptions
- Added the condition for the building for the supported temperature range is 10-40 degrees for whole and the types of rooms.
- Added the condition to continue with the functionalities of building temperature control system or wants to exit it.
  
## Features
- Set the requested building temperature.
- Add new rooms (either apartments or common rooms).
- Automatically adjust room temperatures based on the building temperature.
- Simulate building temperature control with periodic temperature adjustments.
 
## Prerequisites
Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

**Java 8 or later** (for running the Java application)
**Maven** (for building the project)
**Junit** (for testing the project)

## Steps to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/jforjha/building-temperature-control>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
3. Build the project using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    mvn exec:java

## Testing
A test class has been added to ensure the correct functionality of the `Building` and `Apartment` classes. The tests include:
- Validating the building temperature within the acceptable range.
- Testing the functionality of adding rooms to the building.
- Simulating building temperature adjustments and ensuring rooms are adjusted accordingly.

### Test Class
The test class `BuildingTest` is located under `src/test/java/com/model/`. It uses `JUnit` for unit testing the core functionalities of the application. Here are some of the key tests:
- **Test for setting the requested building temperature**.
- **Test for rejecting invalid temperature values** (outside the range of 10â€“40 degrees).
- **Test for adding rooms to the building**.
- **Test for simulating building temperature**.
- **Test for adjusting room temperatures**.

To run the tests:
```bash
mvn test
